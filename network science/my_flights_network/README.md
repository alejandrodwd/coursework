**Making a network of my flights**

Since I was born my parents have tracked every flight I've taken in a little book, a project that I have now taken up. 
So I decided to make a graph representing all the flights I have taken up until now.

I counted them all by hand, but here is a rough visual reconstruction of the book on a world map, which is also interesting to look at.

I used some styling to color code the cities by continent, and this is the final result:

It turned out pretty cool and ultimately, this is what the world looks like to me. This is in essence, the first graphical representation I have seen of “my world”.
It’s certainly skewed in this aspect though, because for example, I’ve never even been outside the Istanbul airport. But it is definitely an interesting visualisation nevertheless.
